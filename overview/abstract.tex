Perhaps the part of security most people intuitively associate with security, 
and computer security in particular, is software security.
This part of computer security treats vulnerabilities in software, e.g.\ 
possibility of buffer overruns or code injections.

Gollmann treats this area in Chapter 10 of his book, 
\citetitle{Gollmann2011cs}~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.
The recommended exercises to do after reading this material are 10.1, 10.3 and 
10.4 in~\cite{Gollmann2011cs}.

Anderson also treats this subject---in Chapter 4.4 and Chapter 18 of 
\citetitle{Anderson2008sea}~\cite{Anderson2008sea}---albeit with less technical 
details.
